accordingly he persuades Mysis to lay it before Simo's door,
and, in an amusing dialogue, which Chremes is purposely .
allowed to hear, he makes her tell him that Pamphilus is the
father. This piece of information has the desired effect3

of these metres; thus· an iambic trimeter is an iambic line,
