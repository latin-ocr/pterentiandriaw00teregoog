appreciate the jolre as the Atheniens would. There was no class at
Rome answering to the Sophists.
58. horum, plural, because quod has been expanded in 56, 57.
nil. The accus. of neuter pronouns and adjectives is not uncommon
aster studere ; ci. Haut. 382, Hec. 199. The construction is also used
by Cicero and Livy. Cs. 157 note.

60. non iniuria, ‘not without cause! cf. 378, Haut. 581.

61. adprime, almost confined to Plautus and Terence, and always
used by them with adjectives. ,

nequid minuatur ἄγαν, a hackneyed Greek proverb. It is
with commonplace reflectious oi this sort that Sosia, like a chorus,
relieves the garrulity ot Simo. Ct. 67, 68, and 142,143.

62. omnis. Some strangely read omnes (nom). It is far more
simple to make the subject oi all the infinitives the same. perferre,
historic infin. Cf. 97, 147, 369. This construction is thoroughly
characteristic ot the style of Terence, who in this respect is, as Spengel
remarks, the Sallust oi early Latin. It will be noticed that he even
uses the historic infin. co-ordinate with a finite verb. if the words
advorsus-illis below were considered to be an interpolation, it would
be possible to regard the infinitives as in apposition to vita.

63. quibus-quomque. Tmesis. Cf. 263, 455, 486.

sese dedere, ‘comply with the wishes οἱ] Cs. 897.

64. sorum, dissyllable. The arrangement ot the first three words
is rather uncertain; and some have suspected that advorms-r'llis is an
interpolation. Bentley has subjected the words to an unsparing criti-
cism, and it must be admitted that the passage does not run very well.
But it is quite in the characteres Simo to enforce his point by the
addition of a couple os participial clauses, in which he lingers on the
merits ot his son. At any rate they sound natural enough on the
stage. Spengel, adding esse to advorsus, turns it into an infin. co-
ordinate with obsequi, etc.; but there is no grammatical difficulty in the
text.

65. illis. Bentley’s correction aliis is unuecessary. The plural
notion is already contained in marini.

lta=quod si sacras. The MSS. give ita ut, which seems very
awkward. Ut probably was introduced on the salse analogy oi such
passages as 80 ila ut fit.

66. invenias. Cf. 571.

68. This line is quoted by Cicero. de Am. § 89, as a general senti-
ment without the qualifying words hoc tempore.

69. mulier quaedam, Chrysis, named in 105.

abhinc. Cf. annote.
