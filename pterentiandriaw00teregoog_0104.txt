1.1.110-1⁴21. mores, 111111 113-148· 73

cito, and Haut. 1013 sed ime egreditur, quom severus. Sometimes we
find quam strengthened by an adverb prefixed ; e. g. mire quarn, sane
quam. cf. 1004101τῶ1 ὡς. The phrase can hardly be explained as=
quam potuit familiariter, 101 this use 01 quam and the positive adjective
or adverb is hardly sound till after the Augustine period. Cf, however,
Caes. B. G. 6. 26 rami quam late diffunduntur.

137. -quid eie. These words occur very osten in Terence. They
are used (1) as a request 101 information, when a remark has not been
sully heard, cf. 184; (1) as an exclamation 01 surprise, when a remark
has been heard, but seems scarcely credible‚ as here, 01. 301, 588, 933 ;
(3) 10 introduce a new point in conversation, or to call any one's
attention, like ‘dis (10103 cs. 517, 575.

aegre ferens, without object expressed, as Adel. 145 aegre pati.

138. ad obiurgandum caueae, cs. 150. Equivalent to the more
regular obiurgandi causa, which we have in 158.

139. quid commerui, ‘what fault have Ι committedi’ We may
say that quid=quam noxiam (Plant. Trin. 18), 01 quam culpam (Phor.
106), 01 quid nmle' (Plaut. Aul. 728). Commerere is used regularly 11 a
bad, as promerere in a good sense.

141. honesta 01011011, ‘it is a fair plea'

143. Fleckeisen is surely wrong (followed by Spengel and Meissner)
in altering dederit 01 the MSS. to dedit. The indic. tulit is necessary,
because it 10101110 a definite act in past time; but qui dederit damnum
bas only a hypothetical existence.

dederit domnum aut melum, ‘committed damage or outrage!

Cf. Plaut. Trin. 219 cum damno et malo, where darneto: ¹ 1110,’ injury to

property, nealo= ‘ punishment: injury to person. Damnum is a passive 1

partic. 01 dare, as damnus, ete.; but the repetition 01 the verb is merely
·accidental.

145. The colon may be placed aster facinus or comperisse. In the
formercase indegnumsaeinus is an exclamation standing alone, as Adel.
173. The rr. recta would be indignum facinus, Simo! comperi Pam·
philum, 010.

147. instetfeotum, (ecesse), ‘he insiste that it is the case’ This
construction occurs Plaut. Merc. 141, and perhaps ‘nowhere else.
Though uncommon, it does not seem odd. Cicero, too, has acc. and
infin. aster the similar verb urgere.

148. qui, indefinite; 01. 6 note. It is grammatically possible 10 take
qui as nom. masc. here, but many other passages make the construction
certain. The word would generally disappear in translation into English,
eg. ‘we part on such terme that he declines to consentio his daughters
marnage.'
