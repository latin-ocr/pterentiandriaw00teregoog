1.1.14-18. aoros, aruns 28-45. , 67

factum gaudeo may be illustrated by Plaut. Most. 5. 2. 26 (1147) benc

hercle sactum, etsuctum gaudeo. But factum gaudeo si tibi quid feci aut
facio sounds rather feebly emphatic.

4²· Scan st ld aarum tifisse.

advorsum ta=tibi
, habeo aratiam. Note the singular with habeo (unlike ago)..
The usage is so thoroughly accepted, that some editors change 770 and
Plaut. Trin. 659 mmntas liabeo gratias (read by every MS.), turning
the latter into summam habebo gratiam. A limit, however, ought to
be put upon this fearless support of rules by the banishment of all erreepn
tions. The only other instance of the plural with tabeo, Phor. 894
gratias habeo atque ago, is explained by the presence of ago. There is a
play on gratum and gratiam, ‘ I am grateful that you are gratified by
my service!

43. Soensad ntomiht

hoc, ‘these words,' i. e. the commemoratio.

44. exprobratiort inmemori. The verbal substantive is often fol·
lowed by the same case as the verb. So Livy ²3· 35. 7 exprobratio
cuiquam ; Verg. Aen. 6. 542 iter Emsiuut. Still more remarkable is
the use of the acc. by Plautus after receptio, curatio, tactio (very often
after the latter).

45. quin dio. Note the following uses of quin :-

(1) ‘why notl’ either in direct or indirect questions;

(2) with imperatives as here: this use wasa natural develop-
ment qf the first; for such a question asquia taceatis equivalent in
sense to a command;

(3) in the common sense ‘but that’ after verbs expressing preven-
tion, doubt, and the like with a negative;

(4) as a corroborative particle, ‘ indeed? ‘verily.' Cf. 704.

quidest, indie, not subjunct. Cf. 449, 849, 878. ‘Iucouversa·
tional or animated language a question is often put, 'logicatty, though
not grammatically dependent on another verb or sentence, e. g. on such .
expletives as dicmilti, cedo, responde, vide, ete So frequently in Plautus
and Terence, even where later writers would make the question depen-
dent and use the subjunctive.¹ Roby, School Latin Grammar‚ 751. Iu
705, quid socies? cedo, the mere order of the words removes all diffi-
culty.

quid est quod= ‘wherefore,’ quod being acc. of respect.

me velis. The ellipse os some such word as conloqui seems the
established explanation3 but if the phrase stood in this passage only,
we might be led by comparing 1. 50 to supply facere, thus giving a very
simple construction to quoti.
