oue on the left to the god or goddess in whose honour the festival was
celebrated3 in this case to Magna Mater or Cybele. See note on the
title. An altar also stood at the entrance of every Roman house.

verbenas, the boughs of the sacred trees, such as laurel, olive,
myrtle‚ with which altars were wreathed. Such boughs were borne by
Fetiales and suppliant priests: they were also used in sacrificial and other
rites. Cf. Verg. Ε. 8. 65, ib. A. 12.120,and Conington's notes on these
passages. Donatus gives the derivation ‘verbenae quasi herbenae!
Servius on Vcrg. E. 8. 65 gives ‘a viriditate! ’

728. ad erum iurandum mihi. The Mss. have iusiurandum,
against the metre, a reading rejected by all editors from Donatus down·
wards. It seems on the whole best to consider iurandum to be for
iurandum esse, an impersonal gerundive construeted after epm sit ; and
to talre ad herum as=apud herum ; cf. Pl. Cist. 1. 1. 100 iuravit apud
matrem meam. Translate, ‘if by chance it may be necessary forme to
talre an cath before my master.’ R. Klotz thinks that iurandum is put
for iurare by a sort of attraction. Others consider that iurandum here:
animandum, quoting PL Cist. a. 1. 26, but the reading in that passage
is very doubtful, and such an ellipse would be against all analogy,
though the construction would in that case find a parallel in 740.
Bentley and others evade the difficulty by reading iurato.

729. liquido, is one of a fairly numerous class of ablatives used
as adverbs, e. g. continuo, crebro, serio, etc. Cf. 533.

necessary!

738. qnod mea opera opus sit vobis, ‘wherein my services may be
needed by you:’ quod is an acc. of respect; cf. 289. For agrees witha
personal construction see 740.

aut is the MSS. reading which most! editors have altered to ut. need-
lessly. The sense is, ‘if there is anything which I can do, or if you see
any further reason (i. e. to make my presence desirable), 1 will semaia!

An amusing scene follows. Davos, pretending to know nothing about
the matter, bullies Mysis into saying before Chremes that the baby
belongs to Pamphilus, while giving her contradictory orders apert, till
