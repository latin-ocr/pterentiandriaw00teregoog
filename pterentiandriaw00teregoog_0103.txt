17 tane animo agresti.
113. humani, ‘sympathetio’
115. eius, i. e. the son. Certainly not humani ingeni, etc.
prodeo. So produco is technically used os conducting a eorpse
to the grave.
116. etiamn ‘yet,' with negative, asin 503. Cic. Tusc. 1. ra. With-

out negative=‘still.' Cf. 940, Verg. Aen. 6. 485 Idaeumque etiam .

117. 01101101, often like ἐκφέρειν, used 01 funerals.

118. mam, prob. emphatic=‘one specially;' though unus some·
times seems to be used as equivalent to an indefinite article.

120. ut nil supra, sc. esse posset.

121. qnia tum, needlessly altered into quac tum or quae quom. The
repetition 01 qma, like that ο1 praeter ceteras (which happily has defied

123. honesta ao liberali, ‘fair and ladylike.’

exanimatus, ‘distracted’ a common use 01 the word.

135. ut cerneres, ‘so that you might have seen! The mood is
really independent 01 ut, and must be explained like that 01 dr'ceret
below. These potential subjunctives (as they are called rather un·

negare· quis eninr redargueret? (i. e. si rugaret). So crederes, uideres, etc.

136. quam familiariter, ‘with all a lover's trust’ (lit. ‘how
