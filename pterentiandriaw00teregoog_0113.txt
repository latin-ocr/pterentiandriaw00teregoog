263. qnae—quomque. cf. 63 note
e'ine ego ut advorsari· can 1 oppose lu'mi’ Note the
emphatic position oi ei. Mad. (§ 353 obs.) explains this construction
as = fierine potest ut, etc, and it is clear that there must be an ellipse oi

sometlpng of the sort. cf. 618, where the interrogative ·ne is
omitte.

264. quorsum aecidat,·what will be the end’ of this hesitation. Cf.
127, 176. Mysis is afraid that the ‘hesitation’ of Pamphilus will end in ,

the desertion of Glycerium. Some alter intertum to incertumst to avoid
the hiatus, which, however, is sufficiently accounted for hythe isolated

position of incertum. It is a further question, whether the hiatus should y
be admitted between- timeo and incertum or incertum and hoc. We follow ¹

Klotz in preferring the latter.
265 peropus, ἅπαξ try. Terence hasalarge number of adjectives
and adverbs compounded with per.

266. paulo momento ‘bya slight impulse! Paulus is used as an ,
adjective by Terence here and Adel. 876. ln later Latin we find the 7

neut. paulum and the comparative adv. paule.

268. dolore, pains of child-birth; in this sense usually plural.

269. nuptiae, of Pamphilus with the daughter of Chremes.

aya-3. ‘Who trusted me with her beart, even with herlife,while1
have made her the darling of my beart, and loved her with a husband’s

love’ The change from indicative to subjunctive is noticeable, but gives ἦ

uo difficulty: quae-credidit merely states the fact, quam-habuerim
states the reason on account of which Pamphilus thought it impossible
to desert her. Terence might have written otherwise, recrediderit-
habui, or two indicatives or two subjunctives. In a case like this a
change of mood merely indimtes a change in the point of view from
which the speaker regards the proposition. If, as here, that change in
the point of viewis intelligible, the grammatical explanation is equally
simple. For a mixture os moods cs. 536, 650, notes,

274. bene et pudice doctum atque eductum, ‘taught and trained
in virtue and purity. '
