The Bembine is by lar the most important, not merely on
account of its antiquity, but because it alone has escaped the
recension of Calliopius in the seventh century. Codex A was
in bad condition, as its owner Cardinal Bembo testified before
the end of the fifteenth century, and Andria 1-786 is now
entirely wanting.

lt bears a note written by Politian (1493 Α. D.) to the effect
that he never saw so old a Codex. The hands ol two correctors
can be discerned: one ol ancient date, which only appears
twice in the Andria, one about the fifteenth century, which
changed and added characters in a ⁴ downright shameless
fashion.’ But, where not thus tampered with, Codex A pos·
sesses an authority sufficient to outweigh all the other MSS.
taken together. The later MSS. were so much altered by the
Calliopian recension that their independent authority is not
very great. ln all MSS, even in A, the spelling has been much
modernised.

The evidence of the MSS. is to some small extent supple-
mented by quotations ol ancient writers and the commentaries
olgrammarians.

Ol these latter, the most important is Aelius Donatus, tutor ol
St. Jerome, about 350 AD, and author ol a celebrated gram-
matical treatise which became the common text-book ol medi-
aeval schools. Priscian (480? A.D.), Servius (about 420 A. D.)
in his notes on Vergil, and other niore obscure scholiasts are ol
occasional service.
