trochaic line, containing four metres or eight ieet. ln the other
. lines, however, i. e. bacchiac, dactylic‚ and cretic‚ each separate
foot is called a metre. Again, some lines have a number of
complete feet3 these are called acatalectic; while others are
called catalectic‚ because the last soot is incomplete. Thus a
trochaic tetrameter catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or
eight feet, wanting the last syllable, and really containing only
seven feet and a half.

Ι. lauare.

(a)1ambio Tetrameter Aoatalectio, called Ootonarius
from its eight complete feet. (Common.)

(b)1ambic Tetrameter cataleotio, called septenarius,
from its seven complete feet (Less common)

(cl1ambio Trimeter Aoatalectio, or senarius. (Very
common; all the plays of Terence begin with it.)

(d) Iambio Dimeter Acataleotio, or quaternarius. (Used
occasionally.)

(e) Iambio Dimeter catalectic. (Rare3 in 485.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi; but the
spondee, tribrach, anapaest, and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must he an iambus, unless, of course, the
verse is catalectic. Moreover‚ as the Tetrameter is regarded as
being composed of two verseS, with the division after the fourth
suot, that foot is usually an iambus ; and such words as ega, tibi,
cedo (cf. 702, 703, 705), are allowed to stand there as if at the
end ofa senarius.

ΙΙ. Taocunrc.

(a) Trochuio Tetrameter Anatolectia or Octouarius.
(N'ot common.) ’

(b) 'Proohaio Tetrameter Cataleotie, or septenarius.
