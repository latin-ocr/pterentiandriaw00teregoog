qnid hominum litigant, ‘what a lot of people have cases on.’
Cf. Pl. Poen. 3. 3. 5 sed quid ln'c tantum hominum incedunt? A similar
carestructio eard σύνεσιν is often found aster pars, quisque, uterque, eto,
e. g. Pl. Trin. 35 faciunt pars dominum.

(1) the yearly produce; (a) food, especially com; (3) the price of grain
or other food ; (4) the maritet. Cf. Pl. Trin. 484 cena dac annana est

faxis. Plautus and Terence use the following forms: saxa (indic),
faxim (subj.)‚ faxis, faxit (indic. or subj.), faximus (subj.), faxitis
(indic. or subj.), faxint (subi). Two views are held with regard to
these forms: (1) they may be syncopated forms for fecero, fecerim, etc,
cf. Zumpt, ξ 161 ; (2) they may be archaia futures, formed exactly like
the Greelr by adding -sa to the verb-stem, e. g. fac-sa=saxa, as τραγ-σω
επρόξοκ the tense in -sim being the subjunctive; cf. Roby, ἐξ 291-3,
Mad. ς 115f.

This philological uncertainty isnot removedby the practical usage of
the forms ln question. In the present passage faxis = jeceris (fut. perf.);
cf. 860; yet saxa is often used where a fut. simple would naturally stand,
and in Adel. 847-8 it is used as a direct coordinate of the future faciam.
The subj. form is never used as a perfect, but always as a future, suh
junctive; cf. the common phrase de' faxint expressive ofa wish, Hor.
Sat. 2. 3. 38 cavefaxeh, and the use of ausim. Cf. 854 note.

in and acc, Eun. 94²· Cicero uses both these constructions und also the
