1.1.66-84. NOTES. LJNES 70·111. 71

oi enimvero seems regular in' Terence. Phor. 528 is a very doubtful
exception.

spectatum, ‘tested' ci 820, Cic. Verres 2. 3. 78 spectatio
pecuniae ; but the metaphor can hardly be extended to conflictatur.

93. ingeniis, ‘characters’ i. e. his friends; abstract for concrete. So
Cic. pro Arch. 5 de ingeniis iudicare os persons.

eius, monosyllable.

94. animus. Note the change oi subject.

mesre. Ci.15note.

95. 'sciassusa both monosyllables. Soscio653, 658. The second
pers. subj. is used here in the general sense, as we say ‘one may know‚'
not to address Sosia. ef. Mad. 5 370.

modum, ‘control’

97. dicore, histor. infin.; cf. 62 note.

fomanus, stronger than the sing.

98. qui. Note that rmas=genitive of ago ,· the relative agrees with
the meaning.

roo. ultro, emphatic, because it was usual sor the father of the
intended bridegroom to make the first proposal, as Philto does, Plaut.
Trin. 449. This is a good example oi the meaning oi ultro.

brought into the text from 47 by some copyist, who did not understand
thatfieriaverac csse ; in fact, that fieri verae is almost nonsense. Ci.
529, 543, where ficri stands alone with the same meaning.

104. forms in diebus paucis, quibus lisso sota sunt, ‘almost
within the few days in the course of which the contract was made!
Scarcely was the betrothal over, when the death oi Chrysis and the
consequent disclosure ruined the hope of Chremes.

106. ibi tum, pleonastic, as in 131, 223, 634. Ibi is temporal,
as also without tum 356, 379; frequentin Livy.

107. qui amabant=amatores, i. e. those who loved her when she
was alive. Amarant is an unnecessary correction.

frequens, used adverbially, = ⁶ often! Frequenter is not found
