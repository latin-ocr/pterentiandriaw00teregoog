74 ANDRIA. 1. 1. 111-153.

149. 11011 tn ibi 11010111, sc. obiurgasti.

151. In the next three lines Simo gives the excuses (apparently con·
sidered valid) which his son would advance. ‘By determining thatI
must marry soon, you have limited my time for intrigue (his rebus);
before long ishall have to obey the whims of a wife (alieno more); let
me have my fling now and sow my wild oats.’

praemripsti=prassmpsista This syncopated form (is being
omitted) of verbs, whose perf. indic. ends in -si‚ is used by Latin poets,
(1) in the second pers. sing. perf. indic. (often) and second pers. plur.
(rarely); (a) in perf. infin.; (3) in pluperf. subj.; the sing. and first
pers. plur. being found3 but none of this last set in Terence. All the
examples in this play are second pers. sing. perf. indic.; cf. 500, 506,
518, 572, 852, 882, 885: iusse occurs Haut. 1001, produxe Adel. 561,
decessu Haut. 52. Vergil has direxti, instruxti, traxe, extinxem, vixit,
and the rare accestis. See the exhaustive note of Klotz on this passage.

151. prope mastonem, ‘the time is soon coming when.¹ Cf.-Adel.
299 nunc illud ert quom.

155. There are two doubtful points, on which it is impossible to pro·
nounce positively: (1) A comma may be placed after ducere ; then the
apodosis is line 156; 01 a full stop, in which case the apodosis is line
154, and line 156 stands by itself; (a) nolit 01 nolet? On the whole we
prefer the former, as having the MSS. authority; also cf. 165, 166, sin
eveniat-restat.

amorem, i. e. 101 Glycerium.
156. ‘This at length will be an act of disobedience on his part, which
1 must punish!
primum, as elsewhere, almost=demum.
0111110, closely with iniuria. Cf. Livy 27. 1 fides a consule.
157-167· Simo now explains his consilium (line 50). ‘I am goingto ·
tell Pamphilus that he must many the daughter 01 Chremes, because (1)
if he refuses,I shall have a definite ground for blaming him ; (1) Davos
always opposes my wishes, and 1 want him to waste his efforts in defeat-
ingan imaginary'scheme; (5) if Pamphilus after all consents, Ihope
to talk Chremes over, and really bring about the marriage (165-167).
157. id operam do. Cf. 507. The neut. pron. is found after such
verbs as gaudere, studere, lacrumare, where the accus. of a substantive
could not stand. Cf. Madv. ξ ²²9· Idoperam (ίαν-111050, and 58 note.
159. sceleratus. So Adel. 553 eccum sceleratum Syrum. The
slave of Latin comedy is usually represented as opposing the wishes of
his master, furthering the schemes of his master‘s son, and looking care·
fully after his own interests.
160. consumat, ‘use it up.'
