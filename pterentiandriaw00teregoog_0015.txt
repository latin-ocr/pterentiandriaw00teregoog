thus brought into close contact with Greek civilisation at the
very moment when they had leisure to attend to it. There
began at once to arise an ever-increasing demand for a better
education for the Roman youth, and for more varied amuse-
ments for the Roman populace. The satisfaction of these
demands was delayed by the First Punic War, 264-241 nc.

Livius Andronicus. ln the next year Livius Andronicus, a
Tarentine captive who received his freedom for educating the
sons of Livius Salinator, produced on the Roman stage ¹ a drama
translated from the Greek. He¹ also translated the Odyssey
into Saturnian verse as an educational text-book, which was
still in use in the boyhood of Horace2. Thus at Rome the
beginnings both of Epic and Dramatic poetry were due not so
much to poetical inspiration as to the needs ol the school-room
and the Circus. As might be expected in work thus done to
order, there was little artistic merit. The lew fragments which
remain seem crude and barbarous‚ and we may well believe
that the books were never again opened when the rod ol an
Orbilius was no longer dreaded.

Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere eoepit,

Esse reor, memini quae plagarum milti paruo
Orbilium dictare.
Hor. Ep. 2. 1. 69-71.
