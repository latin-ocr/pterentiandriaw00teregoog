205. neque tu hoo dices, etc, ‘nor shall you say that you were not
warned of this: i. e. I spealr so plainly, that yon cannot mistake me.
Hoc, given by the MSS, is altered by the editors into haud on the
authority of Donatus, neque haud being understood like the Greek
double negative. But (1) hec gives a perfectly good sense, (κ) Terence
has no other instance of neque haud, though it is true that Plautus has.
(3) Donatus says, ‘tres negativae [ie. neque, haud, reon] pro una negativa
,acceptanturl which clearly shows that he considered neque and haud
not as strengtbening‚ but as destroying each other; and that he objected
to lroc because he thought a third negative necessary to the sense of the
passage} in which view he will not find many followers.

’ Acr Ι. Scnrvn 3.
Davos, alone on the stage, reflects on the difficulties of the situation.

206. enimver03 cf. 91 note. Here, as there, it introduces a ' κ

statement with emphasis. , ¹
’ 208. providentur, ‘ prevented: ' providere in this sense is regularly

ψ ’ followed by the accusative, and it is impossible to understand why some

editors explain quae providentur as irregular torquibus providetur,
which would mean the exact opposite.

210. eius, like illum, refers to Pamphilus: eius and huius are mono·
s llablee.
yara. nequam faciam, etc, ‘lest I should use any intrigue to defeat
this intended match) .

213, 214. Α passage of great difficulty. It seems best to explain the
construction as follows ι-ςί senserit aut causam ceperit is protasis; quo
-dabe't is apodosis ; perii is merely a parenthetical exclamation, not con-
nected with the construction of the sentence; si lubitum fuerit is asubor-
dinate protasis, qualifying causam, equal in sense to quam lubitumfuerit
(capere). Bentley goes so far as to read quam instead of si. Translate,
‘If he actually detecta me, (rnin l) or even finds a pretext satisfactory to
himself, rightly or wrongly he will hurry me off to the mill) The
remaining difficulty belongs to que iure quaque iniuria, which is
equivalent in sense to ecl δικαίως κάδίκως (Aristoph. Plut. 233); but it
seems hopeless to attempt any explanation of the relatives as the passage

stands, unless Terence supposed himself to be translating ὡς δικαίως ’

κάδίκως or something of the sort. Bentley·s emendation qua iureque
me iniuria, (qua-qua=cum-tum as elsewhere), is at any rate
translateable. .1t is usual to take perii and ceperit as apodosis, and
que—dabit as a relative clause, ‘if he detects me, perii ; if he takes the
fancy, he will find a reason for sending me to the millc' a rendering
objectionable (among other reasons) because it contrasts *μνίςίιίκὲ1
