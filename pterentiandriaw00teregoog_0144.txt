IV. ὁ. ra-ar. NOTES. LINES 789-817. 113

γὰρ οὐχ ὡς, θέλομεν ἀλλ’ ὡς δυνάμεθα, and still earlier in Plato, Hipp. Mai.
301. Caecilius used it before Terence in a Latin dress, ‘vivas utpnssis,
quando nan quis ut velis,' and Plautus alludes to it Pers. 1. r. ry.
Latin writers introduce a proverb by aiunt. Cf. Phor. 506, 768.

807. utinum, ‘would that she had) Cicero is rather fond of using
utinam elliptically, especially after quod. .

an is often found in a question apparently simple, but which must
be regarded as the second member of an alternative question, the former
being inferred from the context. An nondum etiam? is here the second
member of ¹iana hic raras parentis repperit?

auspicato. Cf. 533, 729 notes.

adpuli, the reading of all the best MSS, has been altered on very
slender authority to attuli hy Fleckeisen. Crito had come by sea, and
navem adpellere was a common phrase.

808. tetuliasm. Cf. 832 tetulit. These reduplicated tenses offero
are not found elsewhere in Terence, bnt are not uncommon in Plautus:
tetulerunt is once used by Lucretius, 6. 672. These forms are from
a root tol, or tuf, found in τλῆναι, τάλας, tollo. tolerare, ( t statur.

811. lites sequi. Gr. δίκην διώκειν. Cf. Adel. 248, Phor. 408.

quam . . . utile. This is, of course, ironical.

8¹4 munumentum, ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, ‘pretty well grown up.' This
is read by all MS.. but some editors alter it to grandinata to avoid the
syniresis. cf. Haut. 5¹51ard2'wculus·

clamitent, ‘people would cry out’ a potential subjunctive. This
use of the indefinite plural is not usual3 an impersonal constructionis
far more common.

815. noophantam. ByAthenian law successful prosecutors of public
offenders received rewards, often half the penalty, political jealonsy
always gave support to an accusation, and wealthy citizens were often
ready to avert vexatious proceedings by a substantial payment. Ι

All thisencouraged the growth of an unscrupulous class of men who
made their livelibood by laying informatione, extorting money under
threuts of so doing, and similar disreputable practices.

These men were called συκοφάντα. Their name was derived from
σῦκος, a fig, and φαίνειν, to¹ lay information‚ because au ancient law
against the exportation of figs, though unrepealed, became practically
obsolete, and consequently prosecutions under it were considered
peculiarly vexatione. By an easy transition, a sycophant carne to mean
a swindler or pettifogger of any description. See infra 919, Pl. Trin. iv.
sc, a, Aristoph. Achar. 818, Aves 1410, Plut. 850.

816. non lubet, i. e. Crito's own good feeling would prevent him.

817. Notice the hiatus in 0 optume, as in 769.
