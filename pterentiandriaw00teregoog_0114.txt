at any rate 3 if not inhumanus (goinga step higher)‚ by arrror; if not in·
gratus (higher still), by pudor. Tr., ‘So unfeeling‚ so inhuman‚ so
unnatural‚ that neither association (which influeuces even the brute

, creation)‚ nor love (which influences all men), nor honour (which influ-

ences all men of feeling) stir me and admonish me to keep my pledge!
Note the intensive force of con. Cf. Plaut. Trin. 26 conartegabo pro
corenurita noxia, after castigare and meritam have been used.

28². memorassem, an echo of memor esses ,¹ hence the tense and
mood. Cf. 649. ·

283. scripto, predicate.

285. vos, you and the other attendant women.

287. neo elam te est =nec te fugit.

utraeque. An irregular use ol the plural, since two objects,
'not two sets of objecta are meant. However, it is not uncommon;
several instances are given from prose writers. Tho reading rea
nuno utiles (Fleckeisen following Bentley> is unuatural, as giving an
ironical sense to utiles, quite out of keeping with the rest of the

(evidently a gloss) in some MSS. aud the remark of Donatus, ‘legitur

a common introductiou to invocations.

genium tuom, ‘your own sels.¹ Cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 94 quod le
pergenium dextramque deosque Penates Obsecro et obtestor, and Mr.
Macleaue’s note: ‘The Romans believed that every man had a genius,
though their notions on the subject were very confused apparently.
According to the name it should be the attendant on a man's birth, as
it was believed to be the inseparable companion of his lise. It repre-
sented his spiritual identity, and the character ol the genius was the
character of the man ..... This explains the expressions genio indul·
gere, etc!

293· 294. sive—seu. Each=vel si. Cf. 190.

²95- virum. ‘husband'

296. fide. This form of the genitive and dative is common in
Plautus. less frequent iu Terence ; found sometimes in later authors.
