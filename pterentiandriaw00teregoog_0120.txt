det, subjunctive, because not the fact, but the effect upon Simo's
mind, is important. Of course Pamphilus, not Chremes, is the person
with whom Simo will be principally angry; but ‘anger at the refusal of
Chremes’ (which Terence actually writes) is much the same thing as
‘anger with Pamphilus for causing the refusal‘
