ROMAN COMEDV AND T ERENCE. xvii

⁴ the easy yet pointed dialogne, the terse and dramatic descrip-
lions, and the admirable delicacy of the portrayal of character,
won for Terence from the cultured taste of the Augustan age a
more favourable verdict¹ than he could have expected from the
rude and unlettered masses who most enjo'yed the broad fun oi
a boisterous farce. The above characteristics secured for
Terence considerable attention at the Renaissance in Europe.
ln England several ol the minor dramatists are under obliga·
tions to him, while in France his influence prosoundly affected
Moliere, and is in no small degree responsible for the long-
continued servitude of the French drama to the ‘unities' of
time and place which have so cramped its free development.
The Andria has been adapted to the French stage by Baron as
L’Andrienne, while Sir Richard Steele has presented it in an
English dress as T he Conscious Levers.

As might be expected, the characters in Terence, though
admirably drawn, are rather commonplace. No personality in
his plays stands out in the memory like that of Tyndarus in
the Captivi, or Stasimus in the Tm‘nummus. His morality
does not rise above a conventional respectability anda civilised
consideration for others, except where the natural impulses
inspire a generous disposition with something oi nobility.

The disceming criticism os Caesar nearly expresses the more
matured judgment of modern times:

¹ Afranius writes:

Terentio non similem dices quempiam.
Cicero writes:

Tu queque, qui solus lecto sermone. Terenti, ⁸

Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum

In medium nobis sedatis vocibus effers,

Quidquid come loquens alque onmia dulcia dicens.
Horace, Ep. 2. 1. 59, records the general verdict:

¹ dicitur. ..

Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.
Volcatius, on the other hand, places Terence below Naevius, Plautus,
Caecilius, Licinius, and Atilius.
