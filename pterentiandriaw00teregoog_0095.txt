ro. To know one is to know both from their general similarity of plot.

11. nonita, ‘not very,’ a common phrase. The text perhaps gives
the best arrangement of a somewhat doubtful line.

12. oratione ao stilo, ‘execution and form.' Argumentum means
the material of the plot, oratio the manner in which it is worked out,
stilen the form of the language. This last=the word ‘arreptura’ Phor.

14. fatetur. Bentley has a characteristic note: ‘Quis fatetur? an

versus, cx Perinthia hic. Itis true that Terence constautly refers to·
himself in the prologue as tric, e. g. 19;vbut the subject of fatetur is
quite clear without it. Bentley for the same reason alters antehac int0.

transtulisse. The omission of se and other pronouns before the.
infin. is frequent in Terence, eg. 145, 358, 394, 401, 470, etc.

referring them to vituperant, as in 94 in ra rc refers to conflictatur of the
preceding line. Latin writers generally use in ea re, eius rei, etc,
instead of the ambiguous in co, etc.

16. contaminari, lit. ‘to bring into contact' (sor contaminare,
same stem as tango). This verb (but not the substantive contami·
natio) is used here and in Haut. prol. 17 in the sense of amal·
gamating two plays into one. Later it always means, ‘to stain,' ‘to
mar,¹ and thus is found Eun. 55²· The charge of ‘contaminating’
is mentioned by Terence and admitted to be true in this pro-
logue and in those to the Eunuchus and Adelpbi; the latteris

poete, viz. Menander and Diphilus. The charge is also admitted in
the prologue to Hauton Timommenos; though Terence tells usthat that
play, however, is ex integra Graeca integrant cornoeda'arn.
