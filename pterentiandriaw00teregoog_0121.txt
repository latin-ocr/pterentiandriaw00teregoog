will rather marry you to some penniIess girl (whose parents will not be
too particular), than allow you to entangle yourseli with a stranger like
Glycerium! This scheme sounded plausible enough; Chremes spoilt it
by consenting to the match aiter all.

389. hic, ‘thereupon;' like ibi, oi time. Spengel stops aster hic,
which he takes as=pater with iurgabit ; but the adverb is quite
necessary to reddes.

390. ai, like ea (392), is monosyllable.

ut sient must be regarded as an afterthought, since its addition to
the phrase strictly requires facies instead of reddes ; i. e. we should expect
eitherrcdder omnia canolia incerta or facies narnia consilia incerta ut
sient.

391. sina bmni=sine ullo. cf. Plaut. Trin. 338 sine onzni malitia.

39²·393· neo tu ea, etc„ ‘but do not on that account alter your
present conduct (i. e. your intrigue with Glycerium), lest he should
change his determination' (i. e. give you his daughter after all). Davos
means, ‘however determined Chremes is now, we must run no un·
necessary risks.’ But it is possible to take the passage differently.
‘And do not alter your present conduct (i. e. your professed compliance
with your iather’s wishes), merely from sear that (ea causa ne) he may
change his determination? Iu other words, ‘There is no danger in
compliance; you can trust the obstinacy of Chremes.⁸ Here ne mutet
depends on ea causa, not, as in the first case, on minueris. The vagne-
ness of haec quae facis, and perhaps the present tense, are in favour oi
the former rendering.

minuere=mutare. Cf. Hec. 616 sed non artinuam meum
consilium. ·
395-396· nam quod tn, etc, ‘sor though you may hope, “I shall
easily repel a wife by a character like mine, no parent will give one to

allow you toberuined.’ Speras, concessive subjunctive. propulsatae
military metaphor; the bad character of Pamphilus is the weapon with

“No one will give a wisc to a man oi my character ; ¹⁹ he will find, etc?
But this gives a very unnatural sense to propulsabo ; and Iris osoribus
