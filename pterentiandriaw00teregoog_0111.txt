Aer Ι. Scurra t.

Pamphilus complains bitterly of the attempts made by Simo and
Chremes to feroc a wife upon him, protests that he will never leave
Glycerium, and describes how Chrysis on her death-bed committed her
to his charge. Mysis remains in the backgronnd till 267.

The mixture ol iambic and trochaic lines in this soene suits well the
expression of strong feeling.

2 36. hocinest, etc. ‘Is thie the actor purpose of a human being?
is this the duty of a fatherl’ The argument is, ‘il any oue of human
feeling cannot do this, how absurd to say that a father ought to do it l'
ll -ne is added to hice, hacce, hece, the final ι iu these words is changed
into i. For sactum and inceptum some read sactu and inceptu. It
seems to be a matter of speculation; in such a case MSS. do not help
us much, as the final m is indicated merely by a mark over the u.

237. fldem, sc.imploro. Cf. 246, 716 da‘ vostramfidem. Pro does
not affect the case os the word to which it is joined, as may be seen from
euch phrases as pro supreme Iuppiter, pro di immortales.

deum is a monosyllable.
Note quid det si haeo; quidest, sc. coretumelia.

238. dare sese. The common construction after decerno, constitae,
· etc. is the pres. infin. without a subject.

nonne. It is doubtful whether we ought not to read non here
and in the next line. Plautus and Terence ordinarily nse -ue ornan
instead ol nonne. Cf. 17note. ’

2 39. praescisse ante. Note the pleonasm.

Ol oportuit Donatus says quam de stomacho repetitum est.

²4²· suam uxorem. We may scau suam as a monosyllable and¹
elide both vowels, or, consideriug it as adissyllable, shorteu the first
syllable ol uxorem.

id, ‘tris purpose!

inmutatum. If this word is the pass. participle ol inmutare
(cf. 275), it must mean ‘changed' as in has no negative soree in com-
position with verbs. Spengel takes it thus, explaining that Pamphilus’
grief at the idea of marriage had changed into joy when he found that

’ Chremes refused to allow the match. It is much better to consider it as

au adjective, ‘unehauged' The remark is intelligible enough, though
not quite logical. Pamphilus, contrasting the changed purpose ol

Chremes with his own anchangeable srdelity. speaks as if the one were
the consequence of the other.
