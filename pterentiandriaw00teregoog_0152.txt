thus intimatas that the child has died. But such hypotheses are quite un-
neeessary. What more natural than that Davos should flatter his young
master by an extravagant compliment on his infant sorr aud heir? And
the congratulation was not without reason. A match, against a father's
will, with an unknown and almost penniless girl, was likely enough to
have brought both Pamphilus aud his family to ruin. Now his son
would have an acknowledged and honourable position, with the prospect

comedy it was the custom to introduce a lyrical monologue (canticum)
with a flutc accompaniment. Sometimes, as in the Trinummus, this
canticum was made an integral part oi the play, but more commonly
it was performed by a tantor, who also came forward at the end ol a
play and said to the audience ‘plaudite ,·’ cs. Hor. A. P. 155 donec
cantor ‘vos plauditc' dicat. In all Terence's plays the MSS. mark the
cantor byn. The actors are osten indicated by letters of the Greek
alphabet; the cantor, therefore, who appeared at the end of all, is
· indicated by the last letter.
