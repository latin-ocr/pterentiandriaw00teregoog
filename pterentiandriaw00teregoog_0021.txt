xviii INTRODUCTION.

Τ n queque, tn in summis, 0 de'mide'ate Menander,
Peneris et mert‘to, puri sermones amator.

Lenibus atque utinam serespns adiuncta seret vis·
Cemice, nt aequate virtus polleret honere

Cnm Gnaeus, neque in leae despectus parte iaceres,-
Unnm hee macerer ae deleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Not that Terence was devoid of humour ; but his humour is so
delicate and refined that it must often have fallen flat upon the
stage. When his plays are well known their subtle satire and
polished wit can be appreciated ; but there is without doubt an
absence of energy and action (Caesar’s vis comica), which

prevented his pieces from being dramatically successful. An .
audience must be educated up to his plays befone it can perceive .

their many excellenceS.
