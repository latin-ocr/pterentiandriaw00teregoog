ALTER EXITUS.

Iu a few of the later Mss. a second ending, twenty-one lines in
length, is found. This ending was known to Donatus and Eugraphius,
and is certainly of considerable antiquity. Wagner thinks it possible
that it may have been the original ending, but that Terence afterwards

altered it ou finding that the andienoe showed little interest in the
fortunas of Charinus. It seems however far more likely to have been
the addition of some later critic who thought the play incomplete with·
ont a definite settlement ol the second pair of lovers. There are con·
siderable corruptions and omissione in the text; the langnage in more
thau one place is involved aud obscure, though Ritschl. whose emenda-
tions have been generally adopted, has spent on the elucidatiou of this
passage more trouble than perhaps it deserves.

(977-8). Ritschl suggested these lines as a connecting link.

983. alterae for alterius. A dat. lem. sing. alterae is found Haut.
271 ι cf. 608 note.

985. sors romeus, ‘the lot is being drawn!

986. ‘The match to which you reseris not new to me τ’ i.e. Chremes
had known that Charinus wished to marry Philumena, but had enter·
tained other designs for her.

989—90. ‘But I was anxious that our friendship, which hasbeen
hauded down to us by our fathers, should undiminished be handed on
to our children?

amicitia nostua=tiiendship ol Chremes and Simo. The text as
it stands isan anacoluthon, amicitia being a Nominativus pendens. We
should have expected amicitiam nostram . . . nulla parte abdmta.

99²· detur, se. Philumena Charino.

994-7. These lines are very corrupt. If Ritschl’s emendations be
adopted the sense may be aa follows: ‘What shall I say? For to have
found you as well-disposed towards me as before, gives me no lese
pleasure than now to obtain what I seek from you! It is hard to
believe that a passage so awkward aud involved carne from the pen of
Terence.

997-8. ‘When you, sc. Charinus, have devoted yoursell to him, sc.
Chremes, as henceforth will be your aim, do yon form your opinion’

999. monus, ‘estranged’ sc. owing to the matrimonial schemes ol
Chremes.

1000. ‘Yon may guess that to be true from my case,' ie. Chremes

knew only too much about him and his doings.
