to understand how he is concerned with the conduct 01 Pamphilus. Simo
proceeds 10 make it quite clear. The subjunctive must depend onanellipse
01 some word like quaero. This construction is more common when one
speaker quotes a question first asked by the other; e. g. 499, Adel. 84⁴
quidsccit? to which Demea replies quid illcscccrit? (sc. quaeris). Ac·
cordingly some editors assign dac quid sit to Simo. However, Davos
has not asked, as he ought, hcc quid cst? but he may have lcokcd it. ,

qui ament, ie. in love with some one otherthan the proposed uxor.

193· ‘Too osten he guides his heart, love-sick already, towards the
worse object! Cf. 924 sc adplicat, a common phrase. '

ipsum aegrotum must be taken together;=‘love·sick without
the promptings 01 the magister!

195. sane, 1 colloquial word 101 ‘yes,’ like ctiam.

199. verberibus, etc, ‘I will flog you, Dauos, within au inch 01 your
life, and set you in the min! thue ad: ‘right up to but, not including.’
cl. Adel. 90 mulcavit usquc ad martem. Notwithstanding the order 01
the words, it seems best to take usquc aci urcem aiter caesum, not (as
Spengel) aster dedam There ure two threats; verberibus caesum
strengthened by usquc aci necem, and in pistrinum dedam strengthened
by ca lege, etc. ⁴ Ι

200. ea lege atque omine, ‘on the condition and solemn assurance
that? There is no parallel to this use ο1 amm,- but, as Μ1. Papillon
says, the idea 01 · prognostic' may pass into that 01 ‘wurcing‘

201. nondum etiam, an emphatic pleonasm, suetiam with a nega-
tive=ncndum Cf. 116 note.

eallide=planc. We say, ⁴ I shrcwdly suspect!
aaa. loeutus possibly ought to be written locutu's- locutus cs.
circuitione, five syllables, not six. As circuiri (Phor. 614) is
four syllables, not three, and so circuimus, circuit, circuis used by
Plautus, some editors write circum itione separately, so that the 1111
syllable 01 circum may be elided. But this separation seems scarcely
natural, and circuitio might be pronounced circitia.

²03· passus sim. This potential subjunctive (cl. Mad. § 350 b, 135

notetis often used to express in a cautious way what will huppen is

' certain circumstances arise. The perfect tense is usual, as here:

‘I would sooner be deceivedff' Cf. phrases like kaudfacilc macrim,
‘I shall find it difficult to say.'
deludier, archaia iorm 01 infin. pass, used also by poets generally.
204. bone verbe, quaeso, ‘hush, hush,' εεύφήμεη cisarcen linguis.
Davus pretends to be shocked to hear such an ill-omened word as
deludicr applied to his muster.
