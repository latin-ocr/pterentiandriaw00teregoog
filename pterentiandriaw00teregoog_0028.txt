METRES AND PROSODV. xxv

probably suffer elision of both vowels, though we may elide the
last only, and scan ixorem, isse, as already explained.

11. Retentlon of tha quantity of final vowels originally
long. This is much less common in Terence than in Plautus.
Many instances given by Wagner are not certain. Probably
this retention takes place only when it is helped by a pause,
eg. 437 potin es mi verum dicere'.

111. syntzans. Most dissyllabic words, in which no con·

sonant separates the vowels, may be treated as monosyllables;
e. g. 95 scias, 843 meo, 296 tuae, 88ο sui, 210 huius, 93, 210 eius,
765 quoius3 and so Eiram, mio'rum, etc. ; granffscula (814) is
noticeable,if it is the right reading; dehinc and proin are always .
monosyllabic in Terence ln 202 circuitione seems to scan as
circiiione, cu apparently being regarded as = qu.

Elatus is admitted :

(1) When there isa change of speaker, e. g. 616, 665.

(a) When a line is broken by a strong pause, eg. 345.

(3) When a word is isolated by the sense, eg. 264 incertum.
(4) Alter the fourth foot of an Iambic or Trochaic Tetrameter.

It is hardly necessary to note that the interjection 0 is not

elided before vowels, e. g. 769, 817 ; nor is em, cs. 604.
Occasionally a long vowel is shortened instead ol being elided,

eg. 191 qui aniani. cf. Verg. Ecl. 8. 108 an qui amant.
