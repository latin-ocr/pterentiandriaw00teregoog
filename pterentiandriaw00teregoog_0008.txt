PREFACE.

Iu the text of this edition we have followed the MSS.

rather than the emendations ol editors, unless there seemed
to be weighty reasons to the contrary. In the absence,

however, of A, the testimony of Donatus or other Scholiasts ·

as to readings earlier than those in the Calliopian MSS.
has been sometimes accepted, when supported by intrinsic
probability.

In a School edition we have thought it better to print the
letter v, andto adopt the modernised spelling of the MSS,
except in a few cases where the orthography in Terence’s
time was demonstrably different: eg. o is substituted for u
after another u or u3 quor, quotics, quoi, adpulit, etc, appear
for mr, cums, cuz', appulit, etc, and -zi for -es in the accusative
plural of such words of the third declension as make the
genitive plural in -z'um

It is hoped that the stage directions, which have been
mainly suggested by practical experience at Westminster,
may be of real service. As our opportunities of studying
this aspect of the Play are unique, we have endeavoured to
make this part of the edition as complete as possible.
