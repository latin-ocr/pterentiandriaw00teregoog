pror OF 'THE Annam. xix

PLOT OF THE ANDRIA.

The Andria takes its name from the ‘Andrian’ woman, Gly-
cerium, with whose history and fortunes the action of the Play
is largely concerned. The familiar characters of the Latin
Comedy appear on the stage, the respectable father, the
amorous son, and the intriguing slave.

Many years before the time at which the story is supposed
to begin, ChremeS, an Athenian citizen, having to make a
voyage to Asia, left his daughter Pasiphila under the care of

daughter of ChremeS, born since the loss of Glycerium. The
prospect of this match was matred by an accident Chrysis
died, and, when her body was being bumed, Glycerium went
dangerously near thc fire; Pamphilus rushed forward to save
her, and a scene followed, which showed clearly enough how
matters stood. Chremes, on hearing what had happened,
declared that he would not allow his daughter to many such
a man as Pamphilus.

· Act 1. Se. 1. The Play begins with a dialogue, in which
Simo informs his freedman Sosia of the early life of Pamphilus,
