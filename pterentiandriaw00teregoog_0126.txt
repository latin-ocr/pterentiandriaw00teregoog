F or the intensive use of per cf. 265. Pcrscitus puer, ‘a very fine boy;' for
similar use of scitus cf. Phor. 110, Pl. Mero. 4. 4. r 5. Its more common
sense is ⁴ witty,’ ‘elevem‘ ‘sensible,' cf. Pl. Trin. 764. Ecastoria commonly
used by women, edepol by men; cf. 305 note. Mecastor is aleo found,
in which case me is acc. of ego, as in mehercle, medius fidius.

488. quom, ‘since' ‘because' is sometimes constructed with the iudi·
cative in ante-glugustan writersr cf. iufra 623, 771, Phorm. 208, Pl. As.
80-1. in this case it is coordinate with quandoquidem, which is regu-
larly followed by the indic, aud this may have influeuced the construction.

489. vel, ‘for example! This meaning probably arose from an
ellipse of a former alternative; ‘either other instances might be given or·
this;’ cf. Her. 60, Haut. 568.

medat is a potential subj. Cf. 135 note.

aba was a collateral form of ab (cf. ἐκ, ἐξ) used before words
beginning with c, q, t. As early however as Plautus abs is rarely found·
except before tc. Cicero always wrote abs te up to about 55 nc. Oeca-
sioual uses of abs in later authors, e. g. Livy, are probably intentional
archaisms. Iu capello, asporto, ‹ar-pernor (for respuetur), the b has
fallen out. Cf. Pl. Pers. 1. 3. 79 abs chorago, Adel. 254 obs quivis.

490. coram,‚used adverbially. No writer before· Cicero employs

y coram as a prepositiou. Cf. 900.

quid opus facto eeset. Opus cst may be used either impersonally,
followed by au ablative of what is needed, or personally with the thing
needed in the nominative. The phrase quid epus est? aud the like may
be completed by ad with the accusative, e. g. 740, or by an ablative,
which is sometimes perf. pass. part. as here. Roby ξ 507 suggests that
this may be a combination of quid est optas? and quo facto est opus?
Cf. 5²3, 715, 758. For the peculiar construction of 728 sec note on
that passage.
puerperae, dat. commodi.
492· itan . . . itane. Cf. 189 for a similarly emphatic repetition.

appears iu classical prose. cf. 75 7.
494. antem aoonrete, sc. mc falle.
495. edixin tibit=mmne edixi tibi ? Cf. 17 note, 238 note, 504.
