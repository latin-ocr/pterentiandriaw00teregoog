70. viciniae, partitive gen. depending on huc, as osten aiter ubi,
quo, nusquam, etc. lzuc viciniam is a needless correction, and huic
vicinatur, given by the MSS.. a good instance ol a copyist's blunder.

71. cognatorum neglegentia. This means a good deal in the
mouth of an Athenian. At Athens, is an orphan girl was lest poor. the
next os kin was bound by Solon’s law to marry her or to provide a sub-
stantialdowry. Cf. Phor. 125. Coguntur is not used in thetechnical
Roman sense, bnt as a translation of the Greek ἀγχιστεύς. The
ἀγχιστεύς in this case was Crito, who appears 796. As a citizen oi
Andros he was not subject to the Athenian law; so there is no reason
to suppose that it was his legal duty to provide for Chrysis at Andros
He does not appear to have objected to inheriting anything that she
might have leit at her death.

73. ei, inten'ection,=hci.

74. duriter, ‘with hard work! Adverbs in dtur, formed from
adjectives in ·us‚ are common in early Latin, e. g. avariter, arnicitcr,

(as well as humane) and naviter as exceptions.

81. esset, from esse, not from cdere, as suggested by the older
commentators.

payment of a dinner. So Phor. 339 mymbolus=a person who dines
without being obliged to pay.

90. nil quiequam, ‘nothing whatever‚' an emphatic pleonasm; cf.
Phor. 80, 250, and elsewhere in Terence. It is impossible to suppose,
with Mr. Papiilon, that quicquam is an adverbial accusative in these
passages. For though, as he points out, nemo quisquam is not certain
from Eun. 226, the phrase is established by Eun. 1032, Hee. 67.

91. enimvero, ‘of coursc,' ‘naturally’ used also to express anger or
