Pamphilus has just heard from Simo that Chremes‘bas consented to
his daughter's marriage. He comes on boiling with rage against Davos
by whose advice this catastrophe has been brought about, and is only
presented from taking summary vengeance on the slave by the pressiug
necessity of his own position.

607. scelus qui. Cf. 250. The reading oi this line is very doubt·
ful. The MSS. read qui me perdidit, or qui me hodie perdidit. Neither
reading will scan. Hodie was probably supplied from 620, aud perdidit
would be the natural gloss on the aposiopesis qui me . . . On the stage
the sense would be completed by a gesture.

608. nulli, for nullius. Pronouns forming the gen. and dat. in
-e'us and -i are occasionally declined by Terence like a regular ad-
jective iu ·us-a-um; cf. alterae dat. iem. inira 983, Phorm. 928,
