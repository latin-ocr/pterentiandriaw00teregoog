1.1. 134-2. 4. NOTES. LINES 149-175. 75

161. manibus pedibusque, Homer's χερσίν τε ποσίν τε. The phrase
occurs again in 676 without que, which Bentley omits here also. 1f we
accept the omission, it is possible (with Spengel) to extend the asyndeton
to obnixe, aud make mnibus, pedimes, obnixe separately emphasisefac·
turum. Indeed‚asfarasseme goes, onznia maymake a fourth in the list.

162. id. Spengel supplies facturum. This is possible, -but the run
of the words is against such a construction, and there are other passages
where the explanation is inadmissible. See especially 414 note. Itis
better to consider id au accus. of limitation, indicating the scope or
object of the action, and further developed by adeo ut incommodet.
‘Rather with this very object, that he may thwart my wishes? Cf. Eun.
1005 nunc id prodeo ut conveniam Parmenonem.

adeo. Note the uses of aeno:

(1) ‘so far,’ (a) of space, Phor. 55 res adeo redit ; (b) of time, 662;
(c) of circumstance, 245.

’ (a) ‘moreover,’ ‘besides’

(5) adeo ut, ‘ for the purpose that,‘ asin this passage. ,

(4) intensive after (a) pronouns, 415, 5795 (b) after adjectives or
adverbs, 7753 (c) aster conjunctions, 440.

It is possible to take adeo as intensifying id, instead of joining it to ut. ·
164. mala mens, malus animus Aristophanes, Pax 1068 δόλιαι ·

ψυχαί, δόλιαι φρένες. Mem and animus, ‘mind and heart,’ are often
joined by Latin writers, probably without feeling the contrast very

' strongly.

165. sin eveniat. Sin, as usual,in an alternative hypothesis; here
contrasted with si nolit (155).
166. nt sit, epexegetic of quod.
167. confore, impersonal; this and consutorum arethe only forms
' used. The rest of the verb is supplied by confieri.
, 171. nunciam, always three syllables in Plautus and Terence.

i prae, always in this orden cf. Adel. 167 aii prae. Wagner
gives eamus nunciam intro to Simo, aud iprae, sequor to Sosia, on the
ground that the freedman would naturally follow his master3 but
the action of the play requires that Simo should remaiu on the stage,
aud must be responsible for any breach of etiquette.

Aer Ι. Scene 2.

Simo meets Davos, and threatens him with the severest penalties if ho
attempts to prevent the projected marriage.

173. modo, shortly before the conversation with Sosia.

175. mirabar, hoe si sio abiret, ‘I always thought it wonderful if
this conduct was really passing unnotioed,' or, ‘whether this conduct
