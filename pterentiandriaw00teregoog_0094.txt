period of Terence the forms in -umlus and -eudus were used side by sicle
for verbs of the third or fourth conjugation‚ except that -uudus is never
admitted where the verb-stem ends in u or v. The older form was much
affected by Sallust, and is frequently found inAugustau writers, especially
in legal or political phrases (e. g. iure dicundo, res repetundae), being
most common in verbs of the fourth coujugation. Ire and its compounds
always retain the form in -undun while gerundus and ferundus are
usually found in Cicero, Caesar. and Livy. The older form is seldom
used for the gernod, e. g. the MS. authority is unanimous for scribundis
here and for scribendum in 1. '
operam abutitur, ‘uses up his time’ Aburi in the older Latin,
like the Gr. ἀποχρῆσθαι, meant not ‘to misuse,'. but ‘to use entirely3' even
Cicero, when he wishes to give the word the meaning ‘misnae' generally
adds some adverb 'or equivalent expression. It is regularly followed by
the accusative in the comic poeta, by the ablative later. Utor and potior
are sometimes followed by the accusative iu the comic poets ξ fungor
always by accusative, with one doubtful exception (Adel. 603); fruor
always by ablativa, except Haut. 401, where the accusative is found.

6. qni, an old form of the ablativo, used by Plautus and Terence in
several sensesr-(r) as a relative, referring to any gendcr and either
number-‘wherewith’ Cf. 512. (a) As a final particle with a sub·
jnnctive expressing purpose—‘in order that! Cf. 307, 334, and the
present passage. (3) As an interrogative adverb-‘how l' Cf. 150, 302·
(4) Introducing curses (πῶς, utimur). Cf. Phor. 1233 Plaut. Trin. 923,
997 (not common). (5) As an indefinite particle with words of emphasis
(reis), ‘somehow’ e. g. lurclc qui, edepol qui, quippe qui, ct qui. Cf.
148. It is commonly used by the later writers also in utqui, alioqui, etc.

argumentum narret, ‘explain the plot‚’ the natural use of a pro-
logue, though Terence's practice is to make this unnecessary by explain·
ing the argumentum as far as is needfol in the first scene of the play.

7. vetans poetae. This ‘old poet' was Luscius Lanuvinus. Terence
never mentions him by name, bnt refers to him as poeta vetus in the
prologue to Phorm. 1 and 13, and, with the epithet ntaleuolus added, in
the prologue to Haut. 22. ·

8. vitio dent, ‘impote as a fault! ‘The dative sometimes denotes
the design and operation of a thing (that to which it serves and tends).'
Madvig, 5 ²49· So uitio umere, probo ducere, etc. The subject of
dentis the old poet and his party.

advortite is the reading of all MSS.: attendite is given by Donatus.
