Glycerium’s house. In his confusion he mentions that Pamphilus is now
with her, and to shield himself tells Chremes of Crito's assertion thatG1y7
cerium isan Athenian citizen. Simo, in a fury, shouts for Dromo. the
slave who flogged for the household. by whom Davos is carried off bodily
for summary punishment. Shno summons Pamphilus from the house.
