vi 'PREFAOE

We have made constant use of the editions of Umpfenbach,
Fleckeisen, R. Klotz, A. Spengel, Meissner, and Wagner,-
the first two on textual questions only‚—and have occa-
sionally referred to those of Bentley, Zeune (containing the
commentaries os Donatus), Stallbaum, Pany, and Papillon.
