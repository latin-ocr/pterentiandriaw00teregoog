11.1.15-31. NOTES. LINES 301-331. 85

854fax0 (but see note). Cicero is very fond ol using credo thus in au
ironicalsense.

prodat, ‘prolongl ‘lengthen out‚' some days for the marriage;
i. e. ‘let some lew days elapse before the marriage! For this use oi
prodo in the sense of produco (615) cf. Plaut. Trin. 340 illi prodit uitam
admisenizm.

315. adeon, ‘arn Ito go to himl' For this emphatic use of the
pres. indic. instead ot the future or the deliberative subjunct. cl. Verg.
Aen. 3. 88 quem sequimur?

320. ad auxilium copiam=auxili copiam. Ci. 138 note.

32¹· istuc, ‘your request.'

322. postremum. ‘sor the last time.’

324. ne, ‘ really: ' only used with pronouns and their adverbs. cf. 772.

327. principio=adhwru μένς answered by saltem in the next line. ι

ut ne=na Cf. 259·

si id non possst=‘s’il ne se peut.² Terence often has potest im· ,

personally, or witha neut.pronoun for subject. ClPlror. 227, 303, 818.
Seebelnw, 861 note. .

328. hueo (lor haece) is the regular form ol the lem. plur. in Plautus
and Terenoe; probably it remained in use even later. Cf. 438, 656. But
the MSS. often give tae.

329. profer. Either (1) sc. nuptiis, ‘prolong some few days sor
the marriage,’ or (2) sc. nuptias, ‘ put off the marriage sorsome few days,’
taking dtis as acc. os time, not as the object. The first gives an unusual
sense to proferre, but the striking parallel in 313 is almost decisive in
its favour.

dum proficiscor. We might expect the subjunctive, as the idea
os purpose, not os time, is prominent. But aiter verbs of 'waiting' and
suchlilre dum and the indic. is found even in Cicero. Cl. Cic. Att. ιο. 3Ι
ego in Arcano opperior, dum haec cognom and osten in Terence3 ci.
714, Phor. 982 retine dum ego leuc servor evoco Haut. 833. Notice
that such a translation as ‘while I am going’ disguises and does not
explain the difficulty. ΤΙιε idea of purpose will still be the prominent
idea. ,
330. ne utiquam. Always two words in Plautus and Terence, for the
vowel of m must be elided if the first syllable is short; and this is
usually proved by the metre. It is true that neutiquam is possible (not
necessary), Hec 403.

liberi hominis, as vre might say, ‘ oi a gentleman.' ι

3 31. id. ‘ his act?

gratiae adponi, ‘counted as a favour;' lit. ‘be set down to

favour;' cf. Hor. Od. 1. 9. 14 lucro adpone.
