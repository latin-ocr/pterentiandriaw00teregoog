11.6.11-111.1.7. NOTES. LINES 4221-465. 93

442. vla, ‘aright' a remembrance oi Simo's ironical request (190)
that Pamphilus iam redeat in viarm. Recta, which bas got into the
MSS. against the metre, must be a gloss on vrb, due to some one who
did not see that the word has much more point without the adjective.

443. ei, a spondee, as Haut. 455 and always in Lucretius.

dumque aetas tulit. Cf. 188.

445. forum. of character, ‘estimable’ cf. Phor. 3²4 O m'r ferrera
atqueamicus. 0 ,

446. animum adpulit. cf. 1 note.

448. quod, accus. ol respect or limitation. Cf. 376.

, 449. quin dic, quidest. Cf. 45 note.

451. drachumis. The old form from δραχμή was drachuma, as

Alcumena from Ἀλκμήνη, etc.
obsonatum, passive impersonal, but perhaps obsonatus from
deponent obsonari ought to be read.

454. quod dicandum hio aiat, ‘as far as one in my place may
speak :’ ln'c, ‘by me to yon,’ though it may=‘ between ourselves,' i. e.
in the absence ol Pamphilus: siet, cf. 234. The subjunctive is here
used in the relative clause to express ‘limitation’ Cf. Mad. ξ 364, Obs.
n, and such expressions as quod sciam, quod meminerim.

455. quoque, ‘in fact ς’ for the meaning is not, ‘You like others are
stingy,’ but, ‘it is true, as well as declared by Pamphilus, that yon are
stingy.’

per paros nimium Tmesis lor pernimium parce. ct 486.
It is possible, however, that we should read perparce.
non laudo. A comic repetition of Simo's leudo in 443.
457. rai, monosyllable here and in the next line.
veterator, ‘old rascal.’

Aer 111. Scurra 1.

Simo overhears a conversation about Glycerium and her child. He
thinks that the story has been invented by Davos to prevent Chremes
from allowing the marriage between Pamphilus aud Philumena.

459. pol, a common abbreviation sor edepol.

466. invenias. potential subjunctive. Cl. 5 3, 135, etc.

namaa=dicis, as often in Terence.

464. ef. 219.

465. actumst, ‘it is all over,’ an expression used originally in the law·
courts of a case already concluded. So Phor. 419 ‘actum’ aiuoet, ‘ere

agas!
